# uz/unzip

## Why do we need this?
The encoding of zip is different between MacOS and Windows. The filename will be garbled if we extracted the file which is zipped from Windows.
This package assists you in extracting the file with the correct filenameðŸŽ‰.

## Installation

This action allows you to use the command, `uz`, in global enviroment
```
sudo sh install.sh
```

running `uz.sh` can be a alternative solution.
```
./uz.sh <usage>
```

## Usage

ðŸ’¡ Note: The zip file cannot contain space ` `!
```
uz [-t|-â€”target <targetPath>] [-e|â€”-encoding <encoding>] filename[.zip]

Default action is extract file to current path with big5.  
-t, --target: absolute path of target destination
-e, --encoding: encoding of zip file
```
